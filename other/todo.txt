done:          A: when fx4=0 (default) Fx1-3 flip the state. It's ok but not when only one is active. I need to make all active and then start flipping.
                (all active first since if I want to disable everything there is still shift+key)
            B: LED are only on deck 1
            1: fx 1-3:  enabled both: on
                        enabled on only 1 or 2: blinking
                        disabled all: off
                shift press = reset the state to 0 - off
               fx 4: press: change activation based on state: Deck 1 only (on), deck 2 only (blinking), off (off)
               shift press = reset the state to 0 - off
                        What?
                            change everything in the fxplace: buttons and knobs
                            il punto è: voglio che le knob funzionino solo in base allo stato degli fx o voglio controllarle anche con fx4?
                            voglio anche con fx4


5: the 3 mode on the crossfader (smooth, abrupt and circle)
    need to understand where they go in mixxx

6: the browser knob: don't make it flash as default but make it change color based on the point of the song execution (violet to red when the song is ending)

8: when I press shift a lot of lights disappear (but not the hot cue ones)
    it can be cool to exploit this behavior

10: in the .js init() function there are 4 deprecated call (connectControl)

11: I don't understand Sysex messages: not implemented

12: Soft-takeover for pitch and other stuff (like also fx knobs)
    I can put soft take overs also in the xml file (maybe better)

13: check jogwheel functionality

14: The color of hotcues is accessible with engine.getValue('[ChannelN]', 'hotcue_X_color')
    (where N and X are the respective Deck and hotcue whose information is being accessed) as an RGB color code

16: look at other consoles for pad functionalities

18: loop functions (shift etc) look djuce dj software

20: to fix tempo the jog are really bad sensitivity. Fix it (succede solo se la canzone è in stop, probabilmente è più un problema di mixxx che del mapping)

22: shift+knob(browser) per scalare di 10 in 10 nella libreria

23: fix errors in --developer mode

24: slicer:
        b: add the loop variant
        c: make so shift+1 reset the beat to 0/1
        d: change lights: light up the continuing shit + the button I press

        problema: se il loop non inizia sull'1. --> convertire.
        problema: talvolta non funziona, al momento non c'è il -8
        se premo più volte non funziona


25: implement rewind


27: instead of putting sampler cue with the shift try to find a real stop

28: fix the loop: out is autoloop toggle.

29: a lot of stuff (mainly led and status) does not work when I reset the consolle. Fix that.

30: with the soft pause feature, you need to go back to where the pause was (because it is not properly implemented in mixxx)

31: slip is not properly implemented in mixxx. Fix it, so when slip is active, if the song is paused (or the vinyl is stopped), it start to play again at the slip point.

32: colori: sistemare che siano attivi (aka disattivi) di base??
    beatroll cambiare colore
    group 5: 02/03 12/1F 76/74(118/116) 72/70 (114/112) --> this is wrong need to check colors on original excel

33: change sampler with beatjump?? (30-38 vs 70-78s)

34: pad 6 = fx effects

35: Put all pads and pad lights into script... so much better.
