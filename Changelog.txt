7:
	Added BeatAlign and Tempo OK
	Fixed play while cueing
	Changed The FX knob from Dry/wet to SuperKnob(aka intensity) like Serato
	Added MoveHorizontal with Shift+browser (Bentheshrubber)
	Added Leds pad 5
		minor: moved pitch_up into script
	Moved back BeatJump to Pad4 and Sampler to Pad8 (imho better to reach
		beatjump faster, since I'm not using sampler that much). Anyway I left
		the other configuration commented out so it's faster to move from one to
		the other
	BeatJump: added also x16 x32 x64 with the shift. Updated also Leds. (present 
		only in the pad4 version)


6:
	small fixes for beatmatch.
	Added support for double Tempo for beatmatch
	Slicer: Ported and Greatly improved the slicer. Added also the compatibility
	 	with the loop. Problems: Sometimes the slicer does not work properly (if
		you press buttons too fast); looping is not working if loop start is not
		quantized (exactly) on beat 1
	Moved Pad 7 to Pad 5 to allign with Serato and DJuced functionalities
	Moved Beatjump to Pad 8 to allign with Serato and DJuced functionalities
	Moved Slicer to Pad 8 to allign with Serato and DJuced functionalities
	Added shift+keychange (pad 5) will reset the key.

5:
	Fixed a bug: Shift + scratchWheel. It was not a function.
	Added slowed pause function: can be activated separated per deck with
		shift+vinyl.
	Removed an output for FX that seemed not connectd to anything
	Added BPM beatmatch guide.

4:
	Added Pad 7 bottom functions (slider resolution, shift to reset). Still
		missing leds, still missing left and right bottom buttons.
	Added Pad 7 top functions for key changes. Still missing LEDs
	Added Fx4 function for deck select, also filterknob behavior depend on it
	Fixed LED
	Modified Fx and FilterKnob: now Fx4 selects the deck for both buttons and
		knobs. Shift + button resets everything. Fixed Fx only connected to
		deck1. Led still missing

3:
	Shift + Sync: changed to "match key" since it was redundant with long press
		(still missing reset tempo)
	Fixed Fx LED
	Added behavior for filter knobs: now if at least one effect is active they
		will propery control the dry/wet knob of the control. Here there was
		also the possibility to attach this to the super-effects-knob (green)
		but I decided that the wet/dry is better. Tell me if you have different
		ideas
	Fixed Quantize button: now properly activate quatize, instead shift+quantize
		activates the keylock

2:
	Fixed Fx Buttons: Now each fx control the activation of both deck1 and Deck2
		lights are not properly setup yet, knobs not yet working
	Added shift function to sampler: now it will pause (cue) the relative sample

Start:
	Added Fx buttons: they toggle on/off FX effects but only on one deck (not on
		both decks)
	Added Fx Lights. Tested and working (maybe the light is not enough bright)
